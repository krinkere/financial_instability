    <h2>Trading Strategy</h2>
    <p>Call an <strong>open position</strong> a trade that will be terminated in the future when a condition is met.
        A <strong>long</strong> position is one in which a profit is made if the financial instrument traded increases
        in value, and a <strong>short</strong> position is on in which a profit is made if the financial asset being
        traded decreases in value. When trading stocks directly, all long positions are bullish and all short position
        are bearish.</p>

    <p>Here is an example. Let&#8217;s say you buy a stock with the expectation that the stock will increase in value,
        with a plan to sell the stock at a higher price. This is a long position: you are holding a financial asset for
        which you will profit if the asset increases in value. Your potential profit is unlimited, and your potential
        losses are limited by the price of the stock since stock prices never go below zero. On the other hand, if you
        expect a stock to decrease in value, you may borrow the stock from a brokerage firm and sell it, with the
        expectation of buying the stock back later at a lower price, thus earning you a profit. This is called
        <strong>shorting a stock</strong>, and is a short position, since you will earn a profit if the stock drops in
        value. The potential profit from shorting a stock is limited by the price of the stock (the best you can do is
        have the stock become worth nothing; you buy it back for free), while the losses are unlimited, since you could
        potentially spend an arbitrarily large amount of money to buy the stock back. Thus, a broker will expect an
        investor to be in a very good financial position before allowing the investor to short a stock.</p>


    <p>Any trader must have a set of rules that determine how much of her money she is willing to bet on any single
        trade. For example, a trader may decide that under no circumstances will she risk more than 10% of her
        portfolio on a trade. Additionally, in any trade, a trader must have an <strong>exit strategy</strong>, a set
        of conditions determining when she will exit the position, for either profit or loss. A trader may set a
        <strong>target</strong>, which is the minimum profit that will induce the trader to leave the position.
        Likewise, a trader must have a maximum loss she is willing to tolerate; if potential losses go beyond this
        amount, the trader will exit the position in order to prevent any further loss (this is usually done by
        setting a <strong>stop-loss order</strong>, an order that is triggered to prevent further losses).</p>

    <p>We will call a plan that includes trading signals for prompting trades, a rule for deciding how much of the
        portfolio to risk on any particular strategy, and a complete exit strategy for any trade an overall
        <strong>trading strategy</strong>. Our concern now is to design and evaluate trading strategies.</p>

    <h2>Moving Average Crossover Strategy</h2>
    <p>Basic Principle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trade the asset when the fast moving average crosses over the slow moving average.</li>
        <li>Exit the trade when the fast moving average crosses over the slow moving average again.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A long trade will be prompted when the fast moving average crosses from below to above the slow moving average,
        and the trade will be exited when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average later. A short
        trade will be prompted when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average, and the trade will
        be exited when the fast moving average later crosses above the slow moving average.</p>

    <p>How to perform Moving Average Crossover Strategy Trade</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick slow and fast moving average. Usually 20 day average is picked for fast and 50 day average is
        picked for long.</li>
        <li>Identify cross overs of slow and fast by subtracting slow from fast.</li>
        <li>The sign of the difference is called <strong>regime</strong>. If the fast moving average is above
        the slow moving average, this is a bullish regime, and a bearish regime holds when the fast moving average is
        below the slow moving average.</li>
        <li>Identify <strong>trading signals</strong> - When regime changes you have to trade, i.e. when bull regime
        begins, you need to buy, and when bear regime begins you need to sell. (You need better evidence that the
        regime is indeed bear or bull, and not a temp spike.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Backtesting</h2>
    <p>A process of testing a trading strategy on relevant historical data to ensure its viability before the trader
        risks any actual capital. A trader can simulate the trading of a strategy over an appropriate period of time
        and analyze the results for the levels of profitability and risk.</p>
